# Memo Dash Prototype

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dashevo/memo-dash.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dashevo/memo-dash)

> Prototype for the MemoDash app on Dash Platform

*Note: This is based on an old version of Dash Platform code and the code is heavily intertwined with the obsolete version. It is left here as an example / historical artifact for the moment.* **It will not work as-is, and the Platform dependencies will need to be integrated.**
