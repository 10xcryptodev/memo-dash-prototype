# Memo Dash Prototype

Prototype application for the MemoDash DAP on Dash Evolution.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

Ensure you have the latest [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/dashevo/memo-dash
```

Install npm packages:

```
cd evo-contact-list && npm install
```

Start the server

```
npm start
```

(`yarn` is also fine for the main project, but dash-schema only works with `npm`.)

## Running the tests

To run tests, simply run

```
npm test
```

## Built With
